## Project Description
This Hangman project allows users to engage in a classic word-guessing game. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the user has to guess the word letter by letter. The game continues until the user either successfully guesses the word or exhausts all attempts.

### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to practice and demonstrate skills in Python programming, including object-oriented programming, user input handling, and basic game logic implementation.

### What You Will Learn
- Creating and using classes in Python
- Implementing game logic
- Handling user input and validation
- Refactoring code for readability and maintainability
